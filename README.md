statShinyApps
=======

This is a collection of apps created in Shiny/RStudio for demonstrating core stat concepts. 

Many of these apps were originally created by github.com/ShinyEd, with small modifications to better suit my courses at Tarleton State University.  Since then, I have created some new apps (tDist, unequalVariances, bayesFactorCalc).
